1. Our experiments confirm previous results [Wiley 2009].
  Confirmation of previous results was obtained in our experiments [Wiley 2009].

2. We found much higher values with respect to those reported by Pandey [2000].
  Values considerably higher than those reported by Pandey [2000] were observed.

3. These discrepancies are negligible due to the fact that …
  The insignificance of these discrepancies arises from the fact that …

4. To the best of our knowledge no other authors have found that x = y.
  As far as we are aware, the finding that x = y has not been reported by any other authors.

5. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that x = y.
  In conclusion, it is demonstrated by our study that x equals y.

6. Figure 1 clearly shows that these values reach a peak when x = y.
  A clear peak of these values at x = y is illustrated in Figure 1.

7. There is a possibility that dissimilar evaluations would have arisen if the focus had been on x instead of y.
  Dissimilar evaluations might have occurred had the focus been placed on x rather than y.

8. Many attempts have been made [Kim 2009, Li 2010, Hai 2011] aimed at improving performance.
  Numerous researchers [Kim 2009, Li 2010, Hai 2011] have attempted to improve performance.
